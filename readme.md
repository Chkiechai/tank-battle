# Assignment Template

This is a simple skeleton for a programming assignment in typescript. It provides the following scripts:

- `npm run test` runs tests with the `jest` test framework
- `npm run br` builds and then runs the project

The project will be compiled by tsc, then wrapped up into a single `cjs` package that you can just run with node.
